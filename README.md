# arduino-synth

This project is an Arduino library designed to emulate modular synthesizer components, such as oscillators, mixers, and sequencers. It provides a flexible framework for creating and manipulating sound synthesis elements directly on an Arduino, allowing users to build their own custom modular synthesizer setups. The library includes a range of tools for signal generation, sound shaping, and sequencing, enabling both beginners and advanced users to experiment with sound design and create unique audio compositions. With an easy-to-use interface, this library is perfect for DIY audio projects and learning the fundamentals of synthesis.

Components include:
- Tone oscillators with variable waveform control (e.g. sine, square, triangle, sawtooth)
- Low-frequency oscillators to by used as control signals
- Mixers
- Control voltage and gate (VC/Gate) source
- Sequencers
- Digital-to-analog converters (DACs)
